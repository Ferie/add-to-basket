The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa 'Hayward')[3] is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg: 5–8 centimetres (2–3 inches) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1 3⁄4–2 1⁄4 in) in diameter. It has a thin, hair-like, fibrous, sour-but-edible light brown skin and light green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour. In 2017, China produced 50% of the world total of kiwifruit.<br>Kiwifruit is native to central and eastern China.<br>The first recorded description of the kiwifruit dates to the 12th century during the Song dynasty.<br>In the early 20th century, cultivation of kiwifruit spread from China to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred.",
